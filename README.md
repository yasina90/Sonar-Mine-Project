# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction Project-


## Overview of the Project

- The project aims to classify sonar signals to determine if an underwater object is a rock or a mine.
- It utilizes logistic regression as the primary machine learning algorithm for binary classification.
- The dataset consists of sonar signals with 61 features and 209 samples, sourced from the UCI Repository.

## Data Preparation

- The dataset is typically in CSV format and requires preprocessing before training the model.
- Data preprocessing steps may include:
  - Handling missing values
  - Normalizing data
  - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- The last column of the dataset indicates the class label (rock or mine), which is crucial for training the model.

## Model Implementation

- Logistic regression is employed to model the relationship between the features and the binary outcome.
- The model uses a sigmoid function to map predicted values to probabilities between 0 and 1, effectively classifying the input data.
- The training data is used to fit the model, and the testing data is used to evaluate its performance.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gain hands-on experience with logistic regression and its application in binary classification tasks.
- Learn to use Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation and model training.
- Understand the importance of model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.
